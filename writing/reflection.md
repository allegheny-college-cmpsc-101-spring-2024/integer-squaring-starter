# Integer Squaring

TODO: Please make sure that you completely delete the TODO markers and
instructions that have been completed.
Your submitted reflection should be a document that contains polished
technical writing that is suitable for publication on your professional web site.

TODO: Make sure that all aspects of the `writing/reflection.md` correctly use all
of the features of the Markdown standard. This means that, when you preview your
Markdown inside of GitHub is should always be formatted in a suitable fashion.

TODO: Keep a list of references at the end that you used for coding and writing
this assignment.

## Program Output

### What is the output from running the following commands?

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.
TODO: Make sure that the fenced code block designates the content as text.

- `poetry run square --approach for --directory input --file numbers.txt`

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.
TODO: Make sure that the fenced code block designates the content as text.

- `poetry run square --approach while --directory input --file numbers.txt`

### Use an Itemized List to Give the First Three Squared Integers in the Output

TODO: Use an itemized list to give the first three squared integers
produced as output by the final implementation of your program. Itemized
lists have a particular syntax in Markdown.
