# Integer Squaring

TODO: Please make sure that you also completely delete the TODO markers and
their labels from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file. This means
that you should not simply delete the TODO marker but instead delete the
entire prompt so that your reflection is a document that contains polished
technical writing that is suitable for publication on your professional web site.

TODO: Make sure that all aspects of the `writing/reflection.md` correctly use all
of the features of the Markdown standard. This means that, when you preview your
Markdown inside of GitHub is should always be formatted in a suitable fashion.
